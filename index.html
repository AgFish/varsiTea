				<h2>Satisfy your thirst, while fueling your brain.</h2>
				<p>VarsiTea is a kombucha based, naturally carbonated, brain-focused, energy drink.  It is based off many natural ingredients and drank in moderation is a part of a balanced diet.</p>

				<h3>What is Kombucha?</h3>
				<p>Kombucha consists of tea, sugar, clean water and a SCOBY. “SCOBY” stands for symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeasts. The sugar feeds the yeast and bacteria which form the SCOBY layer — the very identifiable, thick, mushroomy layer that rests on the top of the kombucha. This SCOBY adds the flavor, acidity and promotes the fermentation which creates the health benefits. It also contains a small amount of alcohol (only .5%-3% depending on fermentation), gluconic, acetic, lactic acids and some substances that discourage bacteria.</p>

				<h3>The Probiotic Benefits</h3>
				<p>The bacteria-fungus culture creates a tea loaded with beneficial probiotic organisms. The benefits of probiotics are well documented and linked to digestive health and immune function, just to note a few. One study found that kombucha may provide substantial activity for controlling e. Coli and Staph bacteria, a common benefit of many probiotics.</p>

				<h3>How Kombucha Protects the Liver</h3>
				<p>Research suggests that kombucha tea consumption does appear to have protective effects for the liver. [7] One animal study reported that kombucha decreased levels of toxins known to cause liver damage. [8] A similar study reported of anti-stress benefits from the tea. [9] These benefits are unique to Kombucha and do not result from unfermented teas.</p>

				<h3>Kombucha and Stomach Ulcers</h3>
				<p>Research in 2010 indicated the antioxidant effect of kombucha may heal stomach problems from excess acid build-up, such as ulcers. It’s reported that kombucha appears to protect the layer of the stomach which prevents acid erosion of stomach tissue. This results from reduced levels of stomach acid, and has been suggested as a support option for those with stomach ulcers.</p>

				<h3>Kombucha and the Kidneys</h3>
				<p>When researchers tested kombucha on kidneys damaged by environmental toxins, they found that the antioxidant potency of kombucha tea may repair damaged kidney tissue. [15] These findings suggest kombucha tea has potential for many uses beyond the health-focused benefits advocated by traditional consumption and research supported by current research.</p>
